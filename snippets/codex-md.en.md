## Telegram notify (ai-notify-telegram)

When you have completed EVERYTHING the user asked for in the current session, end your final
message with a hidden marker on its own line, including a short summary:

`<!-- AI_NOTIFY_DONE: <task idea 1> | <task idea 2> | ... -->`

Do not use this marker for intermediate progress or clarifying questions. Keep each summary
item short and high-level; do not list edited files or repeat the request verbatim.

When you are truly blocked and need user intervention before you can continue, end your
message with a line starting with `🛑` plus this marker:

`<!-- AI_NOTIFY_ESCALATE -->`

Also use it when you stop to wait for the user to choose a direction or confirm something (e.g. "which option?", "push now?"): without a marker nothing is sent, so the user would not know you are waiting. One short `🛑` line saying what you need is enough.
